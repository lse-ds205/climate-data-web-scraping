Australia,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways ). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant. Australia does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both global domestic pathways and fairness metrics. The CAT rates Australia’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. Australia’s NDC targets emissions 43% below 2005 levels by 2030, including LULUCF. However, this target is dependent on LULUCF sequestration estimates, which fluctuate widely year on year. Using the government’s projections for LULUCF from 2023, this target equates to a reduction of 20% below 2005 levels by 2030 excluding LULUCF. Projections for LULUCF sequestration in 2030 increased nearly fourfold between the government’s 2021 and 2023 projections. This effectively reduces the emissions reduction task for energy, industry, agriculture and waste. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Australia’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Australia’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The CAT rates Australia’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Australia’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. Australia’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Australia’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Australia needs to improve its fair share contribution through both strengthened domestic emissions reductions as well as financing additional climate action in developing countries. Australia’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Critically insufficient”. Australia has committed to increase its climate finance but contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating, Australia needs to increase the level of its international climate finance. Australia has pledged AUD 3bn towards climate finance, encompassing both mitigation and adaptation, for the 2020-2025 period. This amount represents an increase from an earlier commitment of AUD 2bn (Department of Foreign Affairs, 2023). However, concerns remain that this commitment will include the relabelling of existing funds (Oxfam, 2023). The government finally rejoined the Green Climate Fund in 2023, after withdrawing in 2019, albeit with a “modest contribution” of AUD 50 million (ABC, 2023; Minister for Foreign Affairs & Minister for Climate Change and Energy, 2023b). At COP28, Australia joined the Clean Energy Transition Partnership, pledging to end direct public investments into international fossil fuels projects within a year (Minister for Foreign Affairs & Minister for Climate Change and Energy, 2023a). This led the CAT to improve Australia’s fossil fuel finance overseas rating from “Highly Insufficient” to “Insufficient”. However, this does not improve Australia’s overall climate finance rating. To receive a better rating, Australia must increase the level of its international climate finance. Australia's lack of action on climate finance is central to the discussions around COP31. Australia is proposing to host the 2026 Conference of Parties in collaboration with 'the Pacific family'. In March 2023, governments from Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Tonga, Fiji, Niue, and the Solomon Islands issued the Port Vila Resolution. The resolution calls for more public and private funding to facilitate a fair transition away from fossil fuels and a reform of the global climate finance framework (Australia Institute, 2023).",
Australia,Net zero target,"We evaluate the net zero target as: Poor Australia included its target to achieve net zero by 2050 in its updated NDCs in October 2021 and June 2022. The 2022 Climate Change Act enshrined the 2050 target in the law. Australia is preparing a new Net Zero Plan. Its current long-term emissions reduction plan for achieving net zero emissions by 2050, submitted to the UNFCCC as a Long-Term Strategy (LTS), was published in October 2021. The current strategy only reduces emissions by 60% below 2005 levels, excluding LULUCF and offsets. Overall, the plan relies heavily on the future development of low-emissions technology and domestic and international offsets with no plans to phase out coal, curb fossil fuel exports, or hold heavy polluters accountable. The Climate Change Authority (CCA) released its Sectoral Pathways Review in September 2024, which presents emissions reductions pathways to net zero by 2050 encompassing all sectors across the Australian economy. Together with CCA’s forthcoming 2035 targets advice, the sectoral pathways will be used by the government to inform its updated Net Zero Plan. Further analysis of Australia’s net zero emissions can be found here .",
Argentina,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). Developing countries like Argentina may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with a physically required pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal. The CAT rates Argentina's target as ""Highly insufficient"" both when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and when rated against the fair share contribution. Argentina has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both frameworks, fairness and modelled domestic pathways. We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways , or what Argentina needs to do within its own borders. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C by end of the century. We rate Argentina’s 2030 NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Argentina’s NDC target is not at all consistent with any principle of fairness, like responsibility, capability, or equality. If all countries were to follow Argentina’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. The improvement in the CAT rating for Argentina’s NDC target since our last update, from “Critically insufficient” to “Highly insufficient”, is not due to Argentina submitting a new and stronger NDC target, but rather to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. Therefore, this change of ratings does not represent improved climate action on the ground, compared to our previous assessment.

Argentina,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"We evaluate the net zero target as: Poor. In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina’s net zero target does not cover most of the good practice elements identified by the CAT net zero methodology . The target explicitly covers all gases and sectors of the economy, but the government fails to disclose other key information such as the role of carbon dioxide removals. Argentina could improve the target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. For example, the government could set separate emission and reduction targets and clarify its accounting methodology for LULUCF. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero.

EU,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways ). For assessing targets against the fair share , we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant. The EU does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both global domestic pathways and fairness metrics. On October 2023, the EU submitted an updated NDC. The target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) is the same as the previous NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO 2 e implying that it is aiming to reduce net emissions by more than 55%. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation, the target equates to 52% below 1990 levels. The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the EU’s borders. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The CAT’s assessment of the EU’s total fair share contribution takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance. When measured against a fair share emissions allocation, we rate the EU’s NDC target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come from supporting additional emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The EU’s international climate finance is rated “Insufficient” and is not enough to improve the EU’s fair share rating. The EU’s international public climate finance contributions are higher than those of most other governments, but we still rate it “Insufficient.” The EU has committed to increasing its climate finance, but contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating, the EU needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions post-2020 and accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel finance abroad. In its concluded negotiation position for the upcoming CO29, the EU neglects to address the need for significantly scaled-up financial support for developing countries, a key factor for enabling ambitious climate action and ensuring a fair global transition. In 2022, the EU and its member states provided EUR 28.5 bn to developing countries (Council of the European Union, 2023a), but contributions still fall short of its fair share contribution. The EU remains committed through 2025 to the USD 100 bn collective goal of climate finance for developing countries, but the USD 100 bn goal itself is insufficient for the post-2020 period. The EU has not made clear how much its planned international climate finance contributions will be in the coming years. The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation Framework (SFDR) was established to promote transparency in sustainable investments to support informed investment decisions. However, this has failed due to broad and vague definitions of what constitute green investments. For example, European investment funds labelled as ”green” under the SFDR have been directed towards major coal firms outside the EU, including the US, China and India, amounting to EUR 65 million as of April 2024 (Civillini & Rodriguez, 2024). In February 2022, European Commission published a complementary climate-delegated act to its Taxonomy Regulation (Council of the European Union, 2022a), which states that energy generation from fossil gas and nuclear should be classified as transition activities: activities that cannot yet be replaced by low carbon alternatives but that do contribute to emissions reduction. At COP29, the EU has reaffirmed that international public climate finance be focused on delivering on the New Collective Qualified Goal (NCQG). However, the EU has not indicated how much finance the bloc is ready to commit and has added a prerequisite to expand the number of contributors part of its position (CAN Europe, 2024).

EU,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"New 2040 target proposed in February 2024 In February 2024, the European Commission proposed a 2040 target of a 90% net GHG emissions reduction below 1990 levels (European Commission, 2024c). After the elections for the European Parliament, President von der Leyen reaffirmed support for the 90% target (von der Leyen, 2024a), which represents the least ambitious end of the 90-95% range initially recommended by the ESABCC (European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC), 2023). Based on the assumptions in the EU’s Impact Assessment for the 2040 target (European Commission, 2024a), we quantify the target as an 85% emissions reduction from 1990 or 660 MtCO 2 e by 2040 (excluding LULUCF but including industrial removals from DACCs and BECCS). This means that the EU will rely on increasing its LULUCF sinks to achieve the remaining 5–10%. The EU seems unlikely to be able to achieve the upper end of the range because even with its most ambitious LULUCF sink the EU would only able to reach a 94% total emissions reduction in 2040 from 1990. Net zero target In April 2021, the European Union adopted its Climate Law, setting into law the objective of collectively achieving “climate neutrality by 2050.” The objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, as agreed in the European Council’s conclusions from December 2019, has further been included in the EU’s LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in 2020. The EU’s climate neutrality – or, essentially, net zero – target is “Acceptable” in terms of its architecture, transparency and scope, including a legally-binding review and assessment process. At present, a clear separation of the contributions from emissions reductions versus removals is missing, although this is an element that is required of the forthcoming 2040 target. There is room for improvement in the target’s scope, as the Climate Law currently does not clearly state that international aviation and maritime transport emissions are included, and an explanation of why net zero by 2050 constitutes a fair contribution is lacking. The full analysis is available here .",
Costa Rica,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Developing countries like Costa Rica will need support to achieve emission reductions in line with a physically required pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal. Costa Rica has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both fairness metrics and modelled domestic pathways. CAT ratings are based on emissions excluding the LULUCF sector. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT takes two estimates provided by the Costa Rican government and creates a range. For more details, please see the Assumptions section. In the absence of a target conditional on international support, we rate Costa Rica’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Costa Rica’s NDC target is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Costa Rica’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Costa Rica’s updated climate target represents an improvement compared to its first NDC, however it is not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C. To improve its rating and be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Costa Rica could submit a conditional 2030 climate target that is at least 7% lower than its current unconditional target (equivalent to an absolute emissions limit of 11 MtCO 2 e excl. LULUCF in 2030) and, if necessary, outline the international support that it would need to achieve it. We rate Costa Rica’s 2030 NDC target as “1.5°C compatible” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Costa Rica’s NDC target is consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. Costa Rica’s NDC target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range. Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found here .",
Costa Rica,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"We evaluate the net zero target as Acceptable. Costa Rica announced a net zero target for 2050 in its National Decarbonisation Plan 2018-2050 (Government of Costa Rica, 2019c). The net zero target covers most key elements but does not meet best practice standards for some of them. Costa Rica’s target covers all sectors and gases underpinned by emissions pathway analysis and the communication of strategic goals and emissions targets per sector. Pathways and key measures are identified comprehensively with interim goals attributable to discernible periods to reach net zero through domestic actions and without the use of international credits. The Costa Rican government does not provide explicit and transparent assumptions on some key elements. For example, Costa Rica provides no information on its intention to establish a formal periodic review cycle of measures and interim targets. To further improve its strategy, Costa Rica could provide separate targets for emission reductions and removals and include emissions from international bunkers. The policy document has also not yet been enshrined in law, which could make targets and measures legally binding and more robust. In 2019, Costa Rica presented its National Decarbonisation Plan 2018-2050 (Government of Costa Rica, 2019c). In this document, Costa Rica sets a national target of net-zero emissions in 2050—emissions including LULUCF—and describes a roadmap towards achieving this target. According to the sectoral breakdown provided in the plan, emissions in 2050 will be 5.5 MtCO 2 e excluding LULUCF. The pathway towards decarbonisation has been modelled as a linear decrease between 2020 and 2050.",
Colombia,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be, as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Colombia will need international support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders. Colombia has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both metrics. Colombia has not put forward a target conditional on receiving international support. However, the NDC document mentions that for Colombia t o be able to move towards a more ambitious NDC, with additionality and impact, the continuity of international cooperation will be key to continuing on this path in all aspects of its NDC . The CAT methodology shows that provision of international support is consistent with the wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meeting the Paris Agreement's goals. As Colombia has not put forward a conditional target, we assess its unconditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways, i.e. what would need to happen within Colombia’s borders to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Against that framework, the unconditional NDC target rates it as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Colombia’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Colombia’s rating has improved by one category, from “Highly insufficient” to “Insufficient”. The change is due to the manner in which we exclude LULUCF from the NDC, rather than any change in the target itself. In our last assessment, we indicated that there was significant uncertainty on the extent to which Colombia intends to rely on the land sector and so we developed a target range based on different approaches. Due to the further information provided in the country’s latest biennial report, we have dropped the upper end of our range (see Assumptions tab for further details). In addition to being inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to modelled domestic pathways, Colombia’s NDC target is also inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. In order to achieve its fair share contribution under the Paris Agreement, Colombia would need to reach absolute emissions of at or below 139 MtCO 2 e in 2030. We estimate Colombia’s NDC target to be 161 MtCO 2 e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates the target as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Colombia’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Colombia’s target is within the range of what is considered to be a fair global effort, but would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Colombia’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Colombia’s rating has improved by one category, from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient”. The change is due to the manner in which we exclude LULUCF from the NDC, rather than any change in the target itself (see the Assumptions tab for further details).

Colombia,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"Colombia has a net zero GHG emissions target by mid-century. In November 2021, Colombia submitted the National Long-Term Strategy ( E2050 ) to the UNFCCC. The Strategy includes different scenarios and pathways and outlines nine strategic initiatives with 48 transformation options to be considered by decision-makers. In December 2021, with the Law No. 2169 (Ley Climatica N°2169, 2021), Colombia promotes the country's low-carbon development through the establishment of minimum targets and measures for carbon neutrality and climate resilience. This enriches the carbon neutrality target into law. The strategy describes the need to carry out mitigation actions in all sectors, intending to reduce GHG emissions by 90%. A reduction of the remaining 10% of emissions will be achieved through land or carbon capture technology to reach net zero. We evaluate Colombia’s net zero target as “acceptable”. The full net zero target analysis can be found here .",
Colombia,2020 pledge,"Colombia did not submit concrete emission reduction targets for 2020 under the Copenhagen Accord. Instead it set a unilateral target to achieve 77% of its electricity generation from renewable sources by 2020 along with two targets dependent on financial support from Annex I parties: zero deforestation in the Colombian Amazon and a share or 20% biofuels in the country’s total liquid fuel use by 2020 (Bermúdez Merizalde, 2010).",
China,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways ). China will need minimal support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders. China has one NDC (with four energy-related targets) and the CAT rating is based on the two targets which are estimated to have the lowest emission levels: the lower end of the carbon intensity target and the upper end of the peaking target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both metrics. Under China’s peaking and carbon-intensity NDC targets, the targets expected to achieve the lowest emission levels, China’s emission levels would reach 14.0 GtCO 2 e/year in 2030 (the median of the two NDC targets expected to result in lowest emissions). China is likely to overachieve its energy-related NDC commitments with our current policy projections. The CAT rates China’s NDC target against modelled domestic pathways as “Highly Insufficient”. The “Highly Insufficient” rating indicates that China’s NDC target in 2030 is not at all consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow China’s approach, warming would reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. Whether China should or should not receive some climate finance from abroad to reduce its emissions is a matter of debate. Our methods do not provide a clear answer to this question. On balance, the CAT methodology shows that China needing a small but important amount of international support is consistent with the wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meeting the Paris Agreement's goals (the figure above shows it to receive a small contribution). In any case, the NDC target achieved with its own resources would need to be increased significantly to be in line with the 1.5°C limit. China’s emission levels under its NDC commitments are higher than what would be deemed Paris-compatible compared to our “fair share” approach, resulting in our rating of “Insufficient”. The upgrade in rating compared to the previous assessment is due to an update in the underlying data, not because of any actual change in the target. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that China’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. China’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow China’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.",
China,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"We evaluate the net-zero target as: Poor . China submitted its Mid-Century Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy (LTS) on October 28, 2021 to the UNFCCC, which contains the country’s commitment to reach “carbon neutrality before 2060”. The commitment was first declared at the UN General Assembly in September 2020 by President Xi Jinping (FMPRC, 2020). The officially-submitted LTS appears to confirm the commitment covers only carbon dioxide emissions, whereas the CAT had previously assumed the coverage was for all GHGs as claimed by Xie Zhenhua and Tsinghua University. The target is not yet enshrined in an official law but has become a core focus and narrative across all national and subnational planning documents, government notices, and politburo convenings, which was reaffirmed in China’s 2022 “Two Sessions” (Xinhua, 2022). If China’s net zero target was to cover all GHG emissions, its long-term strategy could be within the range of mid-century Paris Agreement compatible emission levels, although compatibility also depends on the shape of the pathway (Yvonne Deng et al. , 2020). Due to the size of China’s emissions, this difference can make up to 0.1°C more (CO 2 only) or less (all GHGs) warming in 2100. Given the LTS submission does not meet the majority of our criteria for a best-practice approach in LTS formulation, we evaluate China’s net-zero target as “Poor”.

Chile,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emission pathways ("" modelled domestic pathways ""). Most developing countries may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with their share of a global least-cost pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal. Chile has put forward two targets in its NDC: one that it will achieve using its own resources, and one that is conditional on specific financial, markets, technological and political conditions and may require international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution and its conditional target, which Chile refers to as its ‘internationally supported’ target, against the level of reductions needed according to the modelled domestic pathways. We rate Chile’s 2030 conditional NDC target – a reduction of up to 45% in net emissions by 2030, subject to international support – as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. This rating indicates that Chile’s conditional target in 2030 is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. To improve its rating and be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Chile could increase the ambition of its conditional 2030 climate target equivalent to an absolute emissions limit of 78 MtCO2e excl. LULUCF in 2030 and, if necessary, outline the international support that it would need to achieve it. While Chile does not explicitly ask for international finance, the NDC states that the 45% reduction target is conditional on specific financial, markets, technological and political conditions. On balance, however, the CAT methodology shows that provision of a small amount of international support is consistent with the wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meeting the Paris Agreement’s goals. The 2020 NDC links the 2030 target to the long-term goal for GHG neutrality by 2050, as well as to planning processes involving governance and existing and future strategies, including the “Long-term Climate Strategy 2050.” According to the NDC text, the current NDC planning and update process should allow for the NDC and its consecutive iterations to be intermediate milestones to achieve the 2050 neutrality goal, i.e. taking into account the necessary measures to reach the goal (Government of Chile, 2020a). It also includes a target to reduce black carbon emissions by at least 25% by 2030 below 2016 emission levels. Black Carbon and Chile’s NDC Chile’s 2020 NDC update includes a target to reduce black carbon emissions, which has substantial co-benefits for human health. However, reductions in black carbon are generally not additional to reductions in CO2, because large fractions of black carbon emissions stem from the same emission sources as CO2. Emission reduction policies therefore often reduce CO2 and black carbon simultaneously, and this is already included in calculations of the emissions reductions required to hold warming well below 2°C globally, like the “emissions gap” and “fair share” reductions (see section on Fair Share ). In its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), the IPCC does not provide calculations of Global Warming Potential for black carbon comparable to those provided for greenhouse gases. The report indicates a net-positive effect on warming of black carbon over time and concludes that reducing black carbon emissions in the short-term would contribute to limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C. For information on Chile’s 2019 draft NDC or its original submission in 2017, see our comparison assessment of Chile’s NDCs and the previous country assessment of the 2017 NDC submission. We rate Chile’s 2030 unconditional NDC target as “Almost sufficient ” when compared to its fair-share contribution to climate action . The “Almost sufficient ” rating indicates that Chile’s unconditional target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Chile’s target is within the range of what is considered to be a fair global effort, but would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. The unconditional NDC target rating has changed from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient”. However, this change is due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al. , 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also include additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. The change of ratings does not represent improved climate ambition, compared to our previous assessment.",
Chile,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"We evaluate the net zero target as: Acceptable. Chile announced its net zero target for 2050 as proposed legislation in the Framework Law on Climate Change in 2020 (President of Chile, 2020) and included it in the updated NDC submitted to the UNFCCC in the same year (Government of Chile, 2020b). In November 2021, the target was also included in the LTS and, since June 2022, it is enshrined in law with the passing of the Framework Law on Climate Change (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022). Chile’s net zero target covers most key elements. It covers all sectors and gases, communicates strategic goals and emissions targets per sector, and provides a detailed methodological framework. Notably, Chile underpins these sector-specific ambitions with detailed emissions pathway analyses and budgets. While Chile does not actively outline any plans to rely on reductions and removals outside its borders, future iterations of its NDC could explicitly rule out international credits. Chile could further improve its net zero target by considering good practice standards for a few elements. It could include international aviation and shipping in its target’s scope, and explicitly elaborate on fairness considerations. For the full analysis click here .",
Canada,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways ). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant. Canada has indicated that it will use market mechanisms to achieve its target, but has not provided full details on the extent of this usage with regard to internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). For the first time, Canada has been explicit about the amount of international credits from the US regional Emissions Trading System (ETS) that it intends to use for its target – it is a small amount 0.6 MtCO 2 e. We have rated its NDC target without credits from the US ETS against global domestic pathways and the NDC target with credits from the US ETS against our fair share metric. The CAT rates Canada’s domestic target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share emissions allocation (“fair share target”). The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Canada ’s domestic target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. In the graph above, the ‘domestic target gap’ shows the difference between where Canada’s updated NDC target is and where it would need to be to be 1.5°C compatible based on global least cost modelling. We rate Canada’s 2030 target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Canada’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share to the global mitigation effort to limit warming to1.5°C. Canada’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Canada’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. To close the ‘fair share gap’ Canada either needs to begin supporting emission reductions abroad (on top of its domestic reductions, not as a means to reach its current NDC target level) or increase its provision of climate finance. Canada’s international climate finance is rated “Highly insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve Canada’s fair share rating. Canada’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Highly insufficient.” In June 2021, Canada announced a doubling of its climate finance commitment to CAD 5.3bn over the next five years (Government of Canada, 2021d). The support will cover mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage measures (Government of Canada, 2022d). While the doubling of future climate finance commitments is a positive, Canada’s CAT climate finance rating is still “Highly insufficient” as its contributions to date (OECD, 2022) have been low compared to its fair share. The CAT weighs absolute contributions the highest amongst the four elements we assess. Canada remains committed to the collective goal of USD 100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries through 2025. However, the USD 100bn goal on its own is insufficient in the period post-2020. Canada is making progress on reducing support for fossil fuel development abroad, but a complete phase-out by 2030 looks unlikely. At COP26, Canada agreed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022”, but it kept the door open to allow for exceptions under certain circumstances (Government of Canada, 2022p; UK Government, 2021) . Its export credit agency claims to be implementing this ban and to not renew unabated fossil investments upon maturity, but foresees this natural turnover to only lead to a 15% reduction in their oil and gas financing by 2030 (Export Development Canada, 2023) To improve its rating, Canada needs to stop funding fossil fuel overseas completely and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.",
Canada,Net Zero target and other long-term targets,"We evaluate the net zero target as: Average . Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021 which enshrined its 2050 net zero target into law (Government of Canada, 2021e). Canada updated its long-term strategy in October 2022. The strategy explores a number of different scenarios capable of achieving net zero emissions in 2050, but neither sets a particular pathway for the country to follow nor outlines the policies and measures needed to achieve its net zero target. Reliance on LULUCF and CDR by 2050 could be as high as 45% of Canada’s emissions in 2020 (or 301 MtCO 2 e). Under all scenarios, Canada is still producing and exporting oil and gas in 2050.

Brazil,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emission pathways ("" modelled domestic pathways ""). Most developing countries may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with its share of a global least-cost pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal. Brazil has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both its fair share contribution and the level of reductions needed in line with modelled domestic pathways. The CAT assesses emissions excluding LULUCF . Our estimates of Brazil’s targets excluding LULUCF — and their corresponding rating — are highly dependent on the assumptions on the extent to which Brazil will rely on the sector to achieve its NDC. Brazil’s NDC mentions their commitment to achieve zero deforestation by 2030 but it does not give further details as to the expected emissions level for the sector in the future. We expect additional clarity from Brazil in its next communication. We rate Brazil’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its share of a global least-cost pathway limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. While the current NDC is stronger than the one submitted in 2022 under the previous administration, it is not enough to improve its rating against our modelled domestic pathways. Brazil is not on track to achieve either its 2025 or 2030 targets and needs to adopt additional policies to cut its emissions. Whether Brazil should receive climate finance from abroad to reduce its emissions is a matter of debate. Our methods do not provide a clear answer to this question. On balance, the CAT methodology shows Brazil needing a small amount of international support is technically consistent with a wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meet the Paris Agreement's goals. However, this contribution would likely be small under most equity perspectives. As a result, the NDC target achieved with its own resources would still need to be improved to align more closely with the 1.5°C limit, regardless of international support. We rate Brazil’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. In 2023, Lula’s administration reverted to the original NDC's absolute emission targets submitted in 2016, which improved this rating by one category compared to the NDC submitted in 2022. However, according to our methodology, this new submission still falls short of being a fair contribution by Brazil to global climate action. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Brazil’s target would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Brazil is not on track to achieve either its 2025 or 2030 targets and will need to adopt additional policies to cut their emissions.

Brazil,Net zero target,"Brazil’s aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a target reiterated in its 2023 NDC submission. However, no further details have been communicated so far, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. As of August 2024, Brazil has not submitted a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC. Aiming for climate neutrality by 2050 is a step in the right direction: transitioning to a low-emissions development pathway in compliance with international climate change commitments. However, Brazil should clearly state its plans for reducing emissions across all sectors of the economy, including LULUCF. The full net zero target analysis can be found here .",
Bhutan,CAT rating of targets,"High resolution We rate where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 if its sectoral measures are fully implemented - against where its emissions would need to be based on a 1.5°C global least cost modelled pathway. On that basis, we find it to be 1.5°C global least compatible. We estimate Bhutan emissions will be between at 1.8-1.9 MtCO 2 e in 2030 if it implements all sectoral mitigation measures presented in its various low emissions development strategies (LEDS) for the transport, agriculture, human settlements, and industry sectors. Our rating is based on the upper value of the range. The ""1.5°C global least cost"" rating indicates that Bhutan’s emissions in 2030 are consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. Bhutan’s target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort. It is important to highlight that Bhutan’s NDC and LEDS provide an estimate of implementation costs for the suggested actions and that Bhutan will need international support to achieve these reductions. If we followed the standard CAT rating method, Bhutan’s NDC target of “carbon neutrality” – which we take as equivalent to its net LULUCF sink of 7.8 MtCO 2 e (CAT rates targets excluding the forestry sector) – would be rated as “Critically insufficient” when compared to the level of emission reductions needed within Bhutan’s borders in order to limit warming to 1.5°C. This rating would imply that Bhutan’s NDC target in 2030 reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. However, Bhutan is already carbon neutral and making efforts to remain carbon neutral through the implementation of policies and measures. Applying our standard methodology would be misleading and unfair. A 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway based on global least cost shows what would be feasible for Bhutan to achieve with international support. A more realistic and fair method would be to apply a rating based on the anticipated level of where emissions would be if Bhutan receives support for all of the measures it has planned, and this is what we have done. We rate where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 under a business-as-usual trajectory against Bhutan’s fair share contribution level. Under this approach, we rate Bhutan as “Almost sufficient”. We estimate Bhutan’s emissions under this approach to be between 3.02-3.13 MtCO 2 e in 2030. Our rating is based on the upper range of the estimate. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Bhutan’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Bhutan’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Again, following the standard CAT rating method – where we would rate Bhutan’s NDC target to “remain carbon neutral”, estimated as 7.8 MtCO 2 e in 2030, against its fair contribution – we would rate Bhutan as “Critically insufficient”. This would indicate that Bhutan’s target in 2030 reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C based on its fair share contribution. However, Bhutan is already carbon neutral and is making efforts to remain carbon neutral through the implementation of policies measures. Applying our standard methodology would be misleading and unfair. For a country like Bhutan, its fair share contribution represents what would be fair to do using its own resources. As Bhutan has indicated it will need support to implement the measures outlined in its NDC, using a business as usual projection is a good measure of where Bhutan’s emissions will be in 2030 with its own resources and thus a more realistic and fair basis upon which to apply the CAT rating. The upper end of range falls within the ""Almost sufficient"" category. Bhutan could become 1.5°C compatible in the future if it slows its emissions growth.

Bhutan,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"Bhutan has set an indicative goal of reaching net zero by 2050 (Royal Government of Bhutan 2021). Bhutan first committed to remain carbon neutral during COP15 in 2009. In its second NDC, Bhutan adopted a net zero emissions by 2050 target, which it has already met given it is currently a net negative emitter. However, the NDC does not sufficiently detail how this target will be monitored and not exceeded in the future. The CAT currently does not evaluate Bhutan’s net zero target due to a lack of information. We will update our assessment once more information becomes available. For the full analysis click here .",
Bhutan,2020 target,"Bhutan adopted a carbon neutral target in 2009 and has respected that target throughout the intervening years. Its ability to achieve this target is due to its large land sector sink, as its fossil emissions have increased during this period.",
New Zealand,CAT rating of targets,"New Zealand’s NDC target in 2030 is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The target aims for GHG emissions to be 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF). The new target equates to around 51 MtCO 2 e/yr by 2030 excluding LULUCF. This is equivalent to 21% below 1990 levels by 2030. New Zealand needs to bring down its emissions level to 47 MtCO 2 e/yr for a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway. We rate this target as “Almost sufficient”, moving up from previous rating of “Insufficient”. The CAT calculates a 1.5°C domestic emissions pathway for New Zealand is 44% below 2005 emissions in 2030 (excluding LULUCF). This rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow a similar approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. We rate New Zealand’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that New Zealand’s emissions in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. New Zealand’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow similar approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. With the 2021 update in its NDC New Zealand’s fair share rating has improved from “Critically Insufficient” to “Insufficient”. A fair share target would require New Zealand to nearly halve this target to 32 MtCO 2 e/yr by 2030 New Zealand’s NDC target would need to be 37% lower to be a 1.5°C compatible in terms of New Zealand’s fair share. The current target is equivalent to 51 MtCO 2 e in 2030 where as a 1.5°C compatible fair share target would be around 32 MtCO 2 e. Substantial improvement is needed. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come in the form of additional support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance. Taking both New Zealand’s emissions reduction target and climate finance into account, we rate the overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”. New Zealand’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Highly insufficient.” The country remains committed to climate finance in the period post-2020 but contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating New Zealand needs to improve climate finance commitments and make explicit commitments to prevent investments in fossil fuel finance abroad. Reported contributions fall short of New Zealand’s fair share contribution to the USD 100bn goal and show no clear trend of increasing. A big disbursement in 2014 distorts the trend. Annual contributions with climate as the main component have been less than a third of 2014 values – but have increased in recent years. New Zealand expects to meet its commitment to deliver a total of NZD 1.3bn in climate finance between 2022 and 2025, but this target is still insufficient. The 2022 budget allocated NZD 840m for international climate finance in addition to pre-commitments (New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2022a). During COP27, New Zealand announced that it would contribute NZD 15m of this climate finance to the Adaptation Fund and a NZD 20m contribution to Loss and Damage (New Zealand Government 2022g; 2022e). New Zealand does not finance fossil projects overseas. New Zealand signed the COP26 statement to end public support to fossil fuels abroad (CNN 2021). In April 2021, New Zealand passed legislation which mandates climate risk reporting for banks, asset managers, and insurers, making it the first country in the world to implement such mandatory climate risk reporting . Financial institutions are required to annually report on governance, risk management as well as strategies for climate change mitigation.

New Zealand,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"We evaluate New Zealand' net zero target as: Poor. New Zealand passed its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act in 2019, which sets a target for all greenhouse gases except for biogenic methane – methane from agriculture and waste – to reach net zero by 2050 (Government of New Zealand 2019a). There is a separate target for biogenic methane emissions to be 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050. The minister of climate change has recommended moving to an all gas net zero target, but the government has not yet acted on this recommendation. In November 2021, New Zealand submitted its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to UNFCCC (Ministry for the Environment 2021e). In the LTS, the government has presented a framework for net zero target including five year review cycles with corresponding emissions budgets. The LTS has identified action areas for key sectors without going into details of the emissions reduction potential of those strategies. New Zealand’s net zero target performs poorly in terms of its scope, target architecture and transparency. While the target architecture of New Zealand’s net zero target is relatively strong, it does not follow good practice on a number of elements. In addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping also remain outside the target’s scope, and the government’s reserving of the right to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target in the case of a significant change of circumstance (New Zealand Government 2020a).

Nepal,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Nepal will need support to achieve those needed reductions with its borders. Nepal has put forward two targets in its NDC. One that it will achieving using its own resources and one that requires international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border defined by a modelled domestic pathway. In the case of Nepal, the CAT could not quantify the unconditional target because an absolute emissions reduction target was not provided, so we use Nepal’s current policy projections as its unconditional target. Nepal’s current “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that its conditional 2030 target reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. If all countries were to follow Nepal’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. We haven’t included all sectoral measures in our assessment of Nepal’s conditional target because the NDC provided limited details on some of the sectoral target, so it was not possible to estimate the impact of all of them. Nepal is encouraged to provide further information on the quantification of its NDC and to exceed this target with international support. Given the NDC has no unconditional emissions reduction target, the CAT therefore had to use Nepal’s current policy projections as its unconditional target. Our current policy projection and the conditional target both fall within the 1.5°C range. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Nepal’s fair share target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Nepal’s fair share target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.

Nepal,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"We evaluate the net zero target as: Average. Nepal announced its commitment to achieving carbon neutrality before, or by, 2045, in October 2021. The long-term strategy sets out targets that cover all sectors of the economy – energy, industry process, agriculture, forestry and land use, and waste. However, the LTS only covers CO 2 emissions despite non-CO 2 emissions accounting for 70% of Nepal total emission (excl. LULUCF) in 2021 (Gütschow, Günther and Pflüger, 2022) . The LTS gives two emission reduction scenarios. The first scenario, With Existing Measures (WEM), takes into account the plans and policies implemented and adopted up to 2020, as well as potential adoption in 2030 and 2050. The WEM scenario does not target carbon neutrality, while the With Additional Measures (WAM) scenario does. The WAM scenario includes more ambitious targets; conditional on international support and aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045 (Government of Nepal, 2021). In the WEM scenario, net CO 2 emissions will be reduced by 30 MtCO 2 e in 2030 and 50 MtCO 2 e in 2050 [GWP AR5]. In WAM scenario, Nepal’s net CO 2 emissions are projected to be negative from 2020 to 2030 due to a LULUCF carbon sink, then remain around ‘zero’ throughout 2035 to 2045 (Government of Nepal, 2021). The LTS outlines investment in clean energy as the main strategy for emission reductions. It also emphasises the significant role of the LULUCF sector in supporting ‘net negative carbon emissions by 2050’. Both scenarios cover energy efficiency improvement, fuel switching and a strong target for electrification across most sectors (Government of Nepal, 2021). For the full analysis click here",

If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Viet Nam,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against indicative national emissions from global least-cost pathways that achieve the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal (called modelled domestic pathways). Viet Nam has put forward two targets in its NDC: one that it will achieve using its own resources (15.8% GHG emissions reduction from BAU) and one that is conditional on international support (43.5% GHG emissions reduction from BAU). We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its borders aligned with a global least cost pathway (modelled domestic pathway). We estimate that Viet Nam’s conditional target would result in an emissions level of 620 MtCO 2 e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030, which we rate as “Critically Insufficient”. This rating is based on Viet Nam’s modelled domestic pathway for a 1.5°C limit. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Viet Nam’s conditional target reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Viet Nam’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. With the NDC update, Viet Nam’s emission reductions under its conditional target have strengthened by 17% but are close to two times higher than the 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway (353 MtCO 2 e) for 2030. Substantial improvement is needed in this target. It is important that Viet Nam sets a stronger target to plan faster emissions reductions, and not lock itself into a high carbon future. We estimate that Viet Nam’s unconditional target would result in an emissions level of 863 MtCO 2 e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030, which we rate as “Critically Insufficient”. This rating is based on Viet Nam’s fair share contribution at a 1.5°C limit.

United Kingdom,CAT rating of targets,"NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only entered power in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement. We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025. The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant. The UK does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both modelled domestic pathways and fairness metrics. When compared against least cost modelled pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C, the UK’s target is rated as ""Almost Sufficient"". The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s domestic target in 2030 is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. This is a downgrade of the UK’s NDC compared to the CAT's 2022 UK assessment, where we rated the UK’s target as 1.5ºC compatible. This is because the CAT is now producing modelled domestic pathways via the latest global scenarios assessed by the IPCC’s AR6 report, rather than the older scenarios from the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5ºC. The lack of progress in global emissions reductions in recent years is increasing the pressure on the emissions cuts needed by 2030. As a result, under the latest pathways, the UK’s emissions need to fall faster to align with 1.5ºC, and the UK’s NDC (which was previously only just aligned with 1.5ºC) has now been downgraded to ""Almost Sufficient"". This highlights the importance of aligning with 1.5ºC in the most robust manner possible. The CAT’s assessment of the UK’s total fair share contribution takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance. When compared against what would be a fair share of effort towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals, the UK’s NDC is rated as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. The UK’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The UK’s current NDC sets a target of 253 MtCO 2 e/yr in 2030 (when expressed in AR4 GWPs excl. LULUCF). To improve its fair share rating, the UK would need to cut emissions by an additional 280–400 MtCO 2 e, to reach negative GHG emissions by 2030. Some of these additional reductions can be achieved domestically, by cutting UK emissions to more than 68% below 1990 levels (WWF, 2020). Where possible, the UK should seek to increase the ambition of its 2030 target to 70% and beyond. Where further emissions reductions are not possible, the UK would need to support climate action in other countries, particularly through capacity building, technology transfer and climate finance. Without this, the UK cannot be seen to be aligned with the Paris Agreement’s commitment to reflect ‘equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities’ in climate action. The UK’s reported contributions to financing emission reductions abroad fall far short of its fair share (Gabbatiss, 2023) contribution to the USD 100 bn goal which itself needs to be increased substantially to help drive the global energy transition (Pachauri et al., 2022). On this (most important) metric, the UK is therefore rated as “Highly Insufficient”. In 2019, the UK committed to doubling its climate finance provision from GBP 5.8 bn (USD 7.6 bn) across 2016–2020 to GBP 11.6 bn (USD 15.1 bn) across 2021–2026 (UK Government, 2019), which earns it an “Almost sufficient” rating for future commitments. However, in July 2021 it was revealed that this would not be new funding, and instead would be taken from the existing aid budget (Merrick, 2021). This is in contradiction with a UN-brokered agreement that such funding would be ‘new and additional’ (UNFCCC, 2011). The UK has also consistently underspent climate finance over 2021–2023 (Rowlatt, 2023), and UK total climate finance provision fell from 2020/21 to 2022/23 (Gabbatiss, 2023). The previous government attempted to meet its target partly by further reclassifying existing aid spending as climate finance (FCDO, 2023). Such an approach is deeply regrettable. The new UK government should aim to reclaim leadership in the area of climate finance by: Committing to reaching the GBP 11.6 bn goal across 2021–2026 Resetting the rules on what constitutes climate finance to put the UK at the front of the pack in terms of tracking climate finance (rather than in the middle with other donors) Committing to an ambitious climate finance goal for post-2026 Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found here .",
United Kingdom,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"We evaluate the net zero target as: “ Acceptable ”. The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019. The Net Zero Strategy released in October 2021 has been submitted to the UNFCCC as the UK’s updated long-term strategy. The net zero target covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. The UK meets good practice for most of these benchmarks, but some elements remain undefined or lacking. For example, a clear commitment not to use reductions or removals outside of the UK, and providing separate targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the target architecture of the UK’s net zero target. The UK was the first major economy to establish and pass a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019 (UK Government, 2019d). The UK’s target covers all sectors and gases and includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation and shipping, this corresponds to 2050 emissions of 0 MtCO 2 e/yr as existing residual emissions from agriculture and other sectors such as international aviation are being balanced by CO 2 removal from BECCS, DACCS and other approaches. For this reason, this does not represent a target to reach absolute zero emissions. For the full analysis click here .",
USA,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against what a country should be doing within its own borders as well as what would qualify as a country’s fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emissions reductions and any emissions reductions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant. The US does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both domestic and fairness metrics. We rate the target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 45%–50% excluding emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry or LULUFC) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the US target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Although the target represents a significant improvement compared to its first NDC, the current target is not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and needs further improvements. We rate the target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 45%–50% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that US’ NDC target for 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The US target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort. The target is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow US’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The US’ international climate finance contributions is rated “Critically insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve the US’ fair share rating. We rate the US’ international public climate finance contributions as “Critically insufficient.” The US has committed to increase its climate finance, but contributions to date have been much lower than its fair share. To improve its rating, the US needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions and accelerate the phase-out of all fossil fuel financing abroad (and not only coal). Contribution levels and trends The US Congress approved a budget allocation for international climate finance of no less than USD 0.9bn (Congressional Research Service, 2024) for FY2024, although the Biden Administration requested an allocation of USD 5bn. As a result of a more stringent federal spending cap, the FY2024 finance provision is less than the provision in the first years of the Biden Administration (Thwaites, 2024). For FY2025, the administration accordingly reduced its requested funding to USD 3.5bn. The US State Department, however, claims it is on track to reach its pledge to contribute USD 11.4bn per year by 2024, with a projected contribution of USD 9.5bn in FY2023 (U.S. Department of State, 2024). The difference between the climate finance commitment approved by Congress and the total claimed by the State Department is due to the fact that Congress’ funding only represents a small share of US’ total international climate finance, as other agencies contribute the bulk of financing (Thwaites, 2024; U.S. Department of State, 2024). However, the sources of the US’ climate finance are not transparently reported. While Congress’ budget allocation does not include any funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the US government has pledged to contribute USD 3bn to the GCF. The GCF is the primary international vehicle for supporting developing countries in their efforts to respond to and build resilience to the climate crisis (DeLauro, 2022). The commitment of USD 11.4bn per year by 2024 falls short of the US’ fair contribution. While the OECD reported in 2022 that international climate finance provided by developed countries exceeded the USD 100bn goal per year for the first time, a “new collective quantified goal on climate finance” for post-2025 is already being discussed by UNFCCC parties (UNFCCC, 2024). To demonstrate global leadership on climate finance and to contribute towards its fair share, the US needs to substantially scale up its international climate finance provisions. The CAT finance rating would improve if the US were to successfully augment its level of finance through a sustained upwards trend in annual contributions. The US has historically provided a significant portion of its climate-related financial contributions as grants, which are more concessional than loans. Climate finance contributions declined during the Trump Administration, but this trend has since been reversed by the Biden Administration, which in 2021 increased its bilateral climate-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) (OECD, 2022). Bilateral climate finance by the US, as reported as principal and significant financing, further increased in 2022 as a result of an increase in adaptation financing. Principal mitigation financing actually decreased by half, from almost USD 1bn to less than USD 500m, reflecting a shift by the Biden Administration towards adaptation financing (OECD, 2024). Overall, the US' allocation of funding to bilateral climate-related ODA increased from 3% in 2021 to 10% in 2022 of total ODA spending, but remains well below the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member countries' average of 24% (Donor Tracker, 2021, 2023). This continues to highlight a substantial shortage in the US' financial commitment to addressing climate change through ODA. Increasing these contributions would not only allow the US to play a larger role in global climate action, but would also align with its renewed commitment to international cooperation under the Biden Administration. Fossil fuel financing abroad The US, along with several other countries, agreed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector” by the end of 2022 (The White House, 2021a). The 2023 G7 Communique claims to have achieved this goal (The White House, 2023d). However, the US has neither developed plans nor introduced policies to implement this commitment. The US also has not supported a proposal put forward by the European Union to end fossil fuel finance from export banks (E&E News by POLITICO, 2024). In 2023, the Export-Import Bank of the US (EXIM), an independent US government agency that provides concessions for projects that seek to boost US exports, continued to lend money to foreign fossil fuel projects, including USD 100m to Indonesia’s national oil company to expand an oil refinery and boost production. Estimates suggest that EXIM’s total lending amounted to USD 1bn in 2023 (Aronoff, 2023). While the US government claims to be actively working with EXIM to end its financing of fossil fuel projects, the export agency itself does not seem to take a proactive role in doing so, claiming it has no jurisdiction to end these projects (Friends of the Earth US, 2024). In January 2024, EXIM’s lack of action resulted in two members of the agency’s climate advisory board resigning over a decision to support a fossil fuel project in Bahrain (Friedman & Tabuchi, 2024). EXIM plans to finance further fossil fuel projects, including in Guyana, Malaysia, Mexico, Mozambique, and Papua New Guinea (Friends of the Earth US, 2024). Although the US has not approved any new domestic coal projects in more than a decade (Friedman & Tabuchi, 2024), the US continues to support existing coal projects abroad, such as the Jawa 9-10 Suralaya Coal Plant in Indonesia and the Long Phu 1 Coal Plant in Vietnam (EndCoal, 2020). The US should stop supporting all fossil fuel developments abroad to improve its climate finance rating.",
USA,Net zero target,"The Biden Administration submitted an updated long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021, in which the US officially commits to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. The net zero target covers all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO 2 removal by nature-based and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning (U.S. Department of State, 2021). The US government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture, and transparency of its net zero target. The government could include international aviation and shipping in its target coverage. It could also explicitly commit to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without the use of international offsets. The target itself could be enshrined in law in combination with adopting a legally binding review, revision, and reporting mechanism. The US government should further explain how its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

USA,2020 pledge,"The effects of COVID-19 induced a temporary drop in emissions that helped the US meet its 2020 targets under the Copenhagen Accord. Total emissions in 2020 decreased by 22% below 2005 as a result of the pandemic-induced economic slowdown. The US 2020 target was to reduce emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 (U.S. Department of State, 2010). Despite reaching the 2020 target, GHG emissions bounced back to pre-pandemic levels in 2021.",
UAE,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways ). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant. The CAT rates the UAE's NDC target as ""Almost sufficient"" when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and ""Insufficient"" when rated against its fair share contribution. The UAE does not specify a conditional target or an international element in its NDC, so we rate the NDC target against both fairness metrics and modelled domestic pathways. CAT ratings are based on emissions excluding the LULUCF sector. To obtain the NDC emissions level excluding LULUCF, the CAT takes the UAE’s own sectoral target for LULUCF, presented in its 2023 NDC update. For more details, please see the Assumptions section. The CAT rates the UAE’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the UAE’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

If all countries were to follow the UAE’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The UAE’s NDC rating has improved compared to our previous assessment for two reasons: First, we have updated the UAE’s historical data, resulting in lower emissions (excluding LULUCF) compared to the previous assessment. Our new estimates come from the UAE’s latest inventory, published in its 5 th National Communication to the UNFCCC. Second, the CAT conducted a literature update to its fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; it also included additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. This update yielded more lenient FS ranges for the UAE, contributing to improve its rating.

UAE,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"In January 2024, the UAE submitted its LTS to the UNFCCC, confirming its target to reach net zero by 2050. The LTS includes several details on the UAE’s target, such as its planned emissions reductions and removals, and sectoral pathways to achieve net zero (Government of the UAE, 2024b). However, the measures planned by the UAE to achieve its target remain problematic, especially due to the continued use of fossil gas for power generation, and the reliance on CCS to reduce a significant share of the country’s emissions. The UAE first announced its intention to reach net zero by 2050 in October 2021 as part of the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative (Reuters, 2021). At COP27, the UAE presented its “National Net Zero by 2050 pathway” with further details.

The CAT rates Türkiye’s updated NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when rated against both modelled domestic pathways and against its fair share contribution. Türkiye has one NDC target.

The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Türkiye’s 2030 target reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limiting warming to 1.5°C. Türkiye’s target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Türkiye’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. We do not have sufficient information to assess Türkiye’s climate finance contribution. Under the UNFCCC, Türkiye is an Annex I country and thus not eligible to receive climate finance through the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Our methods do not provide a clear answer for the need for finance for Türkiye. On balance, the CAT methodology shows that Türkiye should receive limited climate finance, if any.

Thailand,CAT rating of targets,"High resolution The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Thailand has put forward two targets in its NDC. One that it will achieve using its own resources and one that requires international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution (‘Unconditional NDC target against fair share’) and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’). We rate Thailand’s 2030 conditional target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Thailand’s conditional NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, and is associated with a 3 °C-compatible trajectory, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. We rate Thailand’s unconditional NDC target “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share. Thailand’s unconditional targets remain based on an inflated BAU that is significantly higher than its current and planned policy projections, even before the onset of COVID-19. Economic trends post-pandemic now lends even more weight to the possibility that the BAU is unrealistic and should be revised downward, with a corresponding strengthening of its emissions reduction targets.

The 3rd Biennial Update Report notes that in 2018, Thailand had achieved a GHG emissions reduction of 15.76% under its BAU (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2020b).

Switzerland,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways ). For assessing targets against a fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emissions reductions and any emissions reductions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant. Switzerland has clearly stated that it will achieve a portion of emission reductions to meet its NDC target through the use of mitigation outcomes sourced from abroad. To rate Switzerland’s NDC target, we assess a domestic component of its NDC against what needs to happen within its border based on modelled domestic pathways and the full NDC target (reduction achieved both domestically and abroad) against what a fair contribution would be. Switzerland, however, has not communicated a domestic share of its 2030 target in its NDC. Instead, it has remained vague on the extent to which its NDC target will be achieved through domestic reductions. In earlier amendments of the CO2 Act, Switzerland had proposed a domestic share target of at least 75% of the full target by 2030 below 1990 (Schweizer Parlament, 2020). In a follow-up amendment of the CO 2 Act (known as Succession Act) of 2021, however, it included a targeted 67% reduction of the full target (Der Bundesrat, 2021). This has since been replaced by vague comments stating that “The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is primarily achieved with measures within Switzerland. The Federal Council determines the share.” (Bundesgesetz Über Die Reduktion Der CO 2 -Emissionen (CO 2 -Gesetz) (Entwurf), 2022). This wording has remains the same in the current draft of 2024 (Bundesgesetz Über Die Reduktion Der CO 2 -Emissionen (CO 2 -Gesetz), 2024). In January to March 2024, the matter was discussed in commissions in both chambers of Parliament with proposals for 75% and 70% (of the full target) on the table, but all proposals were rejected. Consequently, the Environment Minister Albert Rösti promised that he would propose a 67% share to the Federal Council (Das Schweizer Parlament, 2024). Other official messages imply that at least 30% of emissions reductions (60% of the 50%) will be targeted domestically. To rate Switzerland’s NDC we have therefore had to make assumptions on the domestic component. A range between 30%, which seems to be the current consensus to aspire for (Botschaft Zur Revision Des CO 2 -Gesetzes Für Die Zeit Nach 2024, 2022) and 33%, which was removed from previous drafts for unknown reasons (Der Bundesrat, 2021) and was “promised” by the Environment Minister (Das Schweizer Parlament, 2024) seem to be where Switzerland is realistically headed and was thus assessed here. The lack of specificity regarding the proportion of emissions that Switzerland intends to reduce domestically versus abroad is problematic, as it becomes difficult to assess the effectiveness of its overall emissions reduction strategy. This makes it challenging to hold Switzerland accountable for its emission reduction commitments. Equally, the lack of transparency raises questions about the sincerity of Switzerland's commitment. It is important for governments to provide transparent information on their emission reduction plans, as reducing GHG emissions is a global effort and trust and international cooperation are key. Switzerland intends to achieve the remaining target through Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). Since October 2020, Switzerland has signed bilateral agreements with several countries including Peru, Ghana, Senegal, Georgia, Vanuatu, Dominica, Thailand, Ukraine, Morocco, Malawi, Uruguay, Chile and Tunisia, which establish means of cooperation on the transfer of mitigation outcomes under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement (Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, 2024). While developed countries have to support mitigation in less developed countries, there is a more constructive way to pursue bilateral cooperation, which is climate finance. Governments should prioritise fulfilling their fair share of climate finance contributions before transferring mitigation outcomes supported abroad (Warnecke et al., 2021). To effectively address all these concerns, Switzerland should provide a clear and detailed NDC with deep emission reductions domestically, and provide sufficient climate finance. The CAT rates Switzerland’s estimated domestic target as “Almost sufficient” and its overall NDC target compared with its fair-share emissions allocation as “Insufficient.” We rate the estimated domestic component of Switzerland’s 2030 emissions target, a 30% to 33% reduction below 1990 levels, as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Switzerland’s domestic component of its NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Switzerland’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. We rate Switzerland’s overall NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Switzerland’s NDC target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C . Switzerland’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Switzerland’s approach, warming would reach up to 3°C. Switzerland’s international climate finance is rated “Insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve Switzerland’s fair share rating. Switzerland’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Insufficient”. Switzerland has committed to increase its climate finance and, despite a steady annual increase leading to USD 411m in 2020, its contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. In 2020 Switzerland additionally mobilised USD 106m from the private sector and increased its specific support for bilateral adaptation activities to USD 129m (Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, 2022). Climate finance contributions fall short of Switzerland’s fair share contribution to the USD 100bn goal but show an increasing trend. Several recent developments indicate a commitment to international climate finance. Switzerland is one of the only countries that has explicitly prioritised an equal distribution of adaptation and mitigation funding for public bilateral financing (Alliance Sud, 2020). Other decisions that lead to the upward trend are the increase of the level of official development assistance to 0.5 per cent of gross national income, the gradual shift of development assistance to place an enhanced focus on climate change, and the new strategy for international development cooperation 2021–2024, which provides for an increase in funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation to CHF 400 m (approximately USD 426 m) per year by 2024 (Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, 2022). Switzerland remains committed to the USD 100bn goal in climate finance for developing countries per year through 2025, and it considers multilateral mobilised private climate finance as well as the full-face value of the climate finance outflow of multilateral institutions as climate finance accountable towards the 100 billion US dollars goal. Based on Switzerland's economic performance and the polluter-pays principle, the Swiss government estimates its fair share of international finance contributions to be around CHF 450-600m (Federal Council of Switzerland, 2017). This is close to its current investments; however, civil society organisations recommend a fair share of around CHF 1 bn per year (Alliance Sud, 2020). In addition, the USD 100bn goal itself is insufficient for the post-2020 period, and the scale of financial contributions would remain insufficient to increase Switzerland’s CAT climate finance rating. A clear and sustained increase in international climate mitigation finance is therefore needed. To fulfil the non-domestic component of its emissions reduction target, Switzerland is one of only a few countries that officially intends to achieve part of its NDC target through Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) on the basis of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and has already signed bilateral agreements. Switzerland has signed bilateral carbon credit agreements with Peru, Ghana, Senegal, Georgia, Vanuatu, Dominica, Thailand, Ukraine, Morocco, Malawi, Uruguay, Chile, and Tunisia (Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, 2024). These developments are not rated in the finance component of the CAT rating. Instead, the full international NDC, that includes such agreements, is rated against Switzerland’s fair share goal - and rated “Insufficient”. To align with the sentiment of “highest possible ambition”, Switzerland must first set its domestic NDC within at least an “Almost sufficient” range. Although not transparently communicated (see NDC target), the estimated domestic share in Switzerland lies outside this threshold. As a second step, the country would have to provide its fair share of climate finance. This should be prioritised before purchasing credits and accounting the associated emission reductions. As Switzerland is not providing its fair share of international climate finance, the CAT does not consider it legitimate to offset for the fair share rating. Nevertheless, the CAT does acknowledge the transparency of Switzerland’s credit purchase agreements.

Switzerland,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"Switzerland committed to a net-zero target as part of its long-term strategy submitted to the UNFCCC in January 2021, and in June 2023, in the public referendum on Switzerland's Climate Protection Act, Switzerland's net-zero target was enshrined into law (Bundesgesetz Über Die Ziele Im Klimaschutz, Die Innovation Und Die Stärkung Der Energiesicherheit (KlG), 2023). The net-zero target generally covers key elements and now meets good practice for many of them. Switzerland’s net-zero target covers all sectors and gases underpinned by emissions pathway analysis and the communication of clear strategic goals and emissions targets per sector. It also now covers emissions from fuels for international aviation and shipping that are refuelled in Switzerland. The proposed measures aim to achieve net zero on Switzerland’s own territory, but it reserves the right to use international offset credits, even if only for technically unavoidable domestic emissions. Switzerland's new Climate Protection Act, which was accepted in a referendum in June 2023, introduced interim and sectoral targets and requires the parliament to develop periodic roadmaps for achieving the target (Bundesgesetz Über Die Ziele Im Klimaschutz, Die Innovation Und Die Stärkung Der Energiesicherheit (KlG), 2023). Because of these improvements across several key elements, the CAT now evaluates the scope, architecture, and transparency of Switzerland’s net-zero target as ‘Acceptable’.

South Korea,CAT rating of targets,"High resolution South Korea has clearly stated the extent to which its NDC target will be achieved through domestic reductions and the portion of emission reductions that will be achieved through the support of action abroad. We rate the domestic component of its NDC against what needs to happen within its border based on modelled domestic pathways and the full NDC target (reduction achieved both domestically and abroad) against what a fair contribution would be. We rate South Korea’s domestic target for 2030 as “Insufficient” when compared modelled domestic pathways. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s domestic target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow South Korea’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. We rate South Korea’s overall NDC target (including the domestic and the international element) as “Highly insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that South Korea’s fair share target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow South Korea’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.",
South Korea,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"We evaluate the net zero target as: Average. After former President Moon Jae-in announced South Korea’s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, the government also included this commitment in its updated NDC and its Long-Term Strategy (Republic of Korea, 2020, 2021a). The carbon neutrality target is enshrined in law through the Carbon Neutrality Act, which was passed in August 2021 (Ministry of Environment, 2021) and enforced in March 2022 (Ministry of Environment, 2022b). In October 2021, South Korea published two carbon neutrality scenarios that are leading to net zero emissions in 2050 (Republic of Korea, 2021c). Both scenarios aim for coal phase out before 2050 but remain unclear about the exact phase out year. One of the scenarios maintains a share of natural gas, while the other one phases out gas by 2050 as well.

South Korea,2020 pledge,"Under the Copenhagen Accord, South Korea agreed to reduce its emissions by 30% below business-as-usual (BAU) emissions by 2020. It proposed this unconditional target in November 2009 and submitted it to the Copenhagen Accord on 25 January 2010. Under the BAU projections from the Third National Communication, the 2020 pledge would have resulted in emissions of 551 MtCO 2 e/year excluding LULUCF (equivalent to 83% above 1990 emission levels). Emissions in 2020 exceeded this target by around 21% at 670 MtCO 2 e excluding LULUCF.",
South Africa,CAT rating of targets,"We rate the 2030 reduction target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that South Africa’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow South Africa’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. The CAT rates South Africa’s reduction target based on the upper range of its target, which falls in the “Almost sufficient” range, even if close to the limit to “1.5°C compatible”. If South Africa were to meet the lower end of the range it would be 1.5°C compatible when compared to modelled emissions pathways; however, it would still fall short of its fair-share contribution. South Africa currently relies on foreign investments and international finance support to implement a large percentage of its climate change programmes, and the government also emphasises in its updated NDC that the implementation of its NDC will be enabled by financial support as specified in the Paris Agreement. We rate South Africa’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that South Africa’s target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow South Africa’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. CAT interprets the full NDC target as unconditional. As South Africa only needs to reach its upper end of the target range to fulfil the NDC, we rate that emissions level. If South Africa committed to meeting the lower end of its target range, the rating would change to “Almost sufficient” when compared to the fair share contribution.

South Africa,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"The 2021 updated NDC no longer refers to a peak-plateau-decline (PPD) trajectory. The previous peak-plateau-decline (PPD) trajectory, outlined in South Africa’s South Africa’s Copenhagen Accord pledge, foresaw South Africa reducing GHG emissions to 212–428 MtCO 2 e by 2050 including LULUCF (Department of Environmental Affairs, 2018; Government of South Africa, 2010). South Africa’s Long-Term Strategy submitted to the UNFCCC in October 2020 still refers to this PPD trajectory as a benchmark “in the absence of an agreed quantitative articulation of the vision” (Republic of South Africa, 2020). The CAT no longer considers the previous 2050 target range an official long-term target for South Africa given it is no longer mentioned in the 2021 updated NDC and merely used as a benchmark in the LTS of 2020. South Africa first stated its intention to commit to a net zero CO 2 target (“net zero carbon emissions”) by 2050 as part of a visionary statement in its LTS (Republic of South Africa, 2020). In this context, the National Planning Commission is in the process of developing a common vision for South Africa in 2050 and will subsequently update its Low-Emission Development Strategy. The Just Transition Framework, released by the Presidential Climate Commission in June 2022 and approved by the Cabinet in September 2022, refers to reaching “net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050” (Government of South Africa, 2022b; Presidential Climate Commission, 2022). Given its preliminary nature, and the lack of more detailed information, the CAT currently does not evaluate South Africa’s net zero target. The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government.",
Singapore,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emissions reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant. Singapore has indicated that it may use market mechanisms to achieve its target but has not provided any details on the extent of such usage. In the absence of any clarity on the extent of usage, we have rated its NDC target against both domestic and fairness metrics. While CAT modelled domestic pathways do not reflect Singapore’s particularly low domestic RE potential, these pathways do reflect the rapid decarbonisation in the Southeast Asian region that Singapore should follow, if not lead. Given its context, Singapore can play an even larger role in driving regional decarbonisation and energy collaboration. The CAT rates Singapore's NDC target as ""Highly insufficient"" when compared against modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Singapore’s domestic target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

Saudi Arabia,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates Saudi Arabia’s NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. This rating indicates that Saudi Arabia’s NDC target in 2030 reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Saudi Arabia’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. Saudi Arabia's NDC rating against modelled domestic pathways has deteriorated compared to our previous assessment due to an update in our modelled domestic pathways to the pathways assessed in the AR6. This latest evidence shows that Saudi Arabia requires lower 2030 emissions to be consistent with a 4°C compatible pathway. As a result, its NDC rating is no longer “Highly insufficient” and falls into the “Critically Insufficient” range. Our newer pathways better capture national circumstances - including the recent plateauing in Saudi Arabia's emissions - and for higher temperature levels show less room for emissions growth than the previous set. The CAT rates Saudi Arabia’s NDC target against fair share as “Critically insufficient”.

Saudi Arabia,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"We evaluate the target as: Poor. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced Saudi Arabia’s net zero target for 2060 at the first Saudi Green Initiative Forum in October 2021 (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2021d). However, the target has yet to be enshrined in law, or in a policy document. As of October 2023, Saudi Arabia has not submitted a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC. Since its initial announcement in 2021, the Saudi government has not provided any further detailed information on scope, target architecture, or transparency. Saudi Arabia has not yet provided a clear emissions reduction pathway to net zero (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2021a). The target’s emission coverage remains unclear with the CAT currently assuming that only CO 2 emissions are being covered based on scarce available information. Saudi Arabia intends to reach its net zero target through the Circular Carbon Economy approach, which relies on the use of CCS. The national oil company Saudi Aramco has committed to reaching net zero operational emissions in 2050. However, most oil and gas emissions come from the combustion of fossil fuels, not their production. Saudi Arabia and Aramco’s net zero targets do not take into account emissions resulting from oil and gas exports. They also do not consider the economic risks associated with a continued reliance on fossil fuels exports in a net zero world (for further details, see the “Oil production” section under “Energy supply” here ).

The CAT rates Russia's NDC target as ""Highly insufficient"" when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and ""Critically insufficient"" when rated against its fair share contribution. We assess Russia’s total fair share contribution by considering its emissions reduction target and its climate finance. Russia’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share rating. The CAT rates Russia’s updated NDC 2030 emissions target, at least a 30% reduction below 1990 levels (incl. LULUCF), as “Highly insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Russia’s domestic target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Russia’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. We rate Russia’s updated 2030 NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Russia’s target, compared to what its fair share would be in 2030, reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Russia’s target is not in line with any interpretation of fairness. Substantial improvements are needed. Some of these improvements should be made to the NDC target itself, others could come in the form of additional support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance.

Russia’s international climate finance is rated as “Critically insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve Russia’s fair share rating. Russia’s international public finance contributions are rated as “Critically insufficient”. Russia has not made any substantial contribution to international climate finance since the adoption of the Paris Agreement. To improve its rating, Russia needs to urgently both increase its financial contributions and stop funding fossil fuels abroad. As of August 2022, Russia committed USD 3m in climate finance to the Green Climate Fund in the initial resource mobilisation (IRM) round and USD 10m in the first replenishment round, which lasts until 2023 (Green Climate Fund, 2022). Even considering these commitments, contributions remain critically insufficient considering the size of Russia’s economy and its historical responsibility. Russia actively finances fossil fuels abroad. From 2013 to 2019, Russia sent USD 1.5bn in public finance to countries in Africa and the Middle East to support fossil fuel projects (Ferris, 2021) including coal, such as in the Long Phu Coal Plant in Vietnam (Ferris, 2021; Global Energy Monitor, 2022).

As part of this strategy, Russia has committed to reaching net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2060. The strategy also includes a target to reduce GHG emissions by 80% below 1990 levels by 2050, leaning heavily on negative emissions from the LULUCF sector, which are projected to more than double between 2030 and 2050, from -539 MtCO 2 e to -1,200 MtCO 2 e. The enormous increase in negative emissions achieved through the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector means that steep reductions in emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels would not be necessary to achieve net zero emissions. The steep increase in negative emissions raises questions as to the viability of Russia’s planned approach to reach net zero emissions given emissions from fossil fuel combustion are projected to remain high until 2050.

Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found here . The “1.5°C global least cost” rating indicates that Philippines’ conditional target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. This rating compares the Philippines’ conditional target against global least cost 1.5°C modelled domestic emissions pathway. The Philippines’ conditional target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions. However, it does require international support to achieve. The Philippines’ conditional target is estimated to be 96 MtCO 2 e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF). The Philippines’ unconditional mitigation target is inconsistent with a 1.5°C pathway when compared to its fair share contribution. For the target to be aligned with 1.5°C, it would need to reach absolute emissions of 260 MtCO 2 e or below in 2030. We estimate the Philippines’ unconditional domestic target to be 384 MtCO 2 e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF). The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient”.

This is a step in the right direction: transitioning to a low-emissions development pathway in compliance with international climate change commitments.

Norway,CAT Rating,"We rate NDC targets against what a country should be doing within its own borders based on modelled domestic pathways derived from global least cost pathways as well as what a fair contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C would be. For the latter, we consider both its domestic emission reductions and any emissions reductions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support. Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found here . In its 2020 NDC, Norway had indicated that it may use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement for part of its NDC target if the EU did not also update its target to the same level (Government of Norway, 2020c). In December 2020, the EU submitted its updated NDC to at least a 55% reduction in emissions below 1990 levels. As the EU NDC matches Norway’s latest unconditional target of at least 55%, we interpret this target as being a domestic one for the time being, (i.e. with no emissions reductions achieved through international credits), although this may change in the future. In its 2022 NDC, Norway states it could use Article 6 mechanisms to meet emissions reductions going “beyond what is achieved through the climate cooperation with the European Union”. The CAT rates Norway's NDC target as aligned with least cost modelled domestic pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C and ""Insufficient"" when rated against its fair share contribution. As Norway does not have an emissions reduction target that includes non-domestic emissions reductions, as is the case with Switzerland, for example, we rate its NDC target against the two rating frameworks. Norway’s updated NDC broadly aligns with the least cost modelled pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C with no low overshoot. Norway has committed to strengthening its 2030 target to at least a 55% reduction below 1990 levels, which was formally communicated to the UNFCCC in 2022. This represents a reduction of emissions of 50% below 2020 levels, excluding LULUCF. The “1.5°C global least cost” rating indicates that Norway’s NDC target in 2030 is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C on a globally cost-effective basis. We rate Norway’s updated NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Norway’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Norway’s NDC target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. However, it will not be feasible for Norway to achieve all these emissions reductions domestically. Therefore, Norway will need to develop clear and ambitious plans to support climate action in other countries, particularly through capacity building, technology transfer and climate finance. If all countries were to follow Norway’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Norway’s international climate finance contributions are rated “Insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve its fair share rating. Norway’s international public finance contributions are rated “Insufficient”. The country is the only one to meet our benchmark for current contributions based on the USD 100 billion commitment and is committed to doubling its climate finance from NOK 7bn (USD 770m) in 2020 to NOK 14bn (USD 1.54bn) by 2026 at the latest (Government of Norway, 2021b). Despite this pledged increase, current contributions are yet to reach levels sufficient to be considered aligned with the least cost modelled domestic pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C with no low overshoot Norway’s international contributions are the highest among CAT countries considering its mitigation obligation. Norway also ranks first in finance provided per capita and per GDP. Some of the country’s main initiatives are the Norwegian International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) and contributions to multilateral institutions and funds, such as the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). A high share of Norway’s contributions has climate as a main objective and is based on grants. Overall, yearly contributions slightly decreased from before Paris until 2019, but 2020 saw a sizeable increase year-on-year. The Norwegian International Climate and Forest Initiative, the country’s largest program, has been extended to 2030 . Norway also announced an increase in contributions to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and other multi-lateral channels (Government of Norway, 2019a). Norway has not committed to stop funding fossil fuels overseas and continues to allow new domestic oil and gas exploration. Norway’s parliament voted in 2019 to divest part of its sovereign-wealth fund investments on fossil fuels; however, investment in major oil companies remains.

Its emissions in 2020 were 49.3 MtCO 2 e (excl. LULUCF), which are only 4% below 1990 levels (Government of Norway, 2022a).",
Nigeria,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Nigeria will need support to achieve those needed reductions with its borders. Nigeria has put forward two targets in its NDC: one that it will achieve using its own resources and one that requires international support. We rate Nigeria’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution as “1.5°C compatible” and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border defined by a modelled domestic pathway as “Almost sufficient”. In its 2021 NDC update, Nigeria committed to reducing emissions by 47% below BAU by 2030, conditional on international support. This is equivalent to an emissions level 1% above to 23% below 2010 levels by 2030, excluding LULUCF. While this is a strong conditional target, Nigeria will need to strengthen its policies to make sure it has the enabling conditions in place to meet the target, in addition to receiving international support. The CAT rates Nigeria’s 2030 conditional target as “Almost sufficient,” a rating that indicates that Nigeria’s conditional NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Nigeria’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Nigeria’s conditional target spans the CAT’s ""Almost sufficient"" and 1.5°C compatible ratings. The large target range is due to uncertainty around the extent to which Nigeria plans to rely on the land sector in meeting its target. Further clarity from Nigeria on this may result in a 1.5°C compatible target. In its 2021 NDC update, Nigeria recommitted to unconditionally reducing emissions 20% below BAU by 2030. This is equivalent to an emissions level of 17-27% above 2010 levels (excl. LULUCF) by 2030. The CAT rates Nigeria’s 2030 unconditional target as 1.5°C compatible. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Nigeria’s unconditional NDC target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Nigeria’s unconditional NDC target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range. The fair share literature for Nigeria is sparse and some equity categories have few data points. As a result, the upper bound of Nigeria’s fair share range is dominated by a handful of studies. This high range is not reflective of the majority of the literature, which indicates more stringent emission reductions. Future equity studies may help to improve the fair share analysis for Nigeria.",
Nigeria,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"In November 2021, Nigeria passed the Climate Change Act that seeks to achieve low greenhouse gas emissions, green and sustainable growth by providing the framework to set a target to reach net zero between 2050 and 2070 (Okereke & Onuigbo, 2021). The Act includes provisions to adopt National Climate Change Action Plans in five-year cycles that are meant to ensure national emissions are consistent with a carbon budget (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2021). However, the government has not met the initial deadlines set in the Act. The full net zero target analysis can be found here .",
Kenya,CAT rating of targets,"High resolution NDC description The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Kenya will need international support to achieve those needed reductions within its borders. Kenya’s NDC target outlines the mitigation costs that will be financed using its own resources versus those requiring international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution (‘Unconditional NDC target against fair share’) and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’). The CAT rates Kenya’s conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways as “Critically insufficient” and its NDC target against fair share as “1.5°C compatible”. The strong difference in the two ratings reflects Kenya’s situation as a country with strong development needs and a small historical responsibility, but with relevant mitigation potential on its own territory, which it should exploit to a large extent with the help of international support. We rate Kenya’s conditional NDC as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that it reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Kenya’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. Kenya should improve its conditional target and specify support needs to achieve it. Even a small improvement in the target would change the rating to “Highly insufficient”. We rate Kenya’s 2030 unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible” when compared with its fair-share contribution to climate action. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Kenya’s unconditional NDC target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

If all countries were to follow Kazakhstan’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. However, the conditional target is very close to the upper limit of this rating category, meaning that a small change in the numbers could lead to a worse rating. We rate Kazakhstan’s 2030 unconditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Kazakhstan’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Kazakhstan’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Japan,CAT rating of targets,"The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways ). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant. Japan has indicated that it may use market mechanisms to achieve its target but has not provided sufficient details on the extent of such usage. In the absence of the clarity on the extent of usage, we have rated its NDC target against both global domestic pathways and fairness metrics. The CAT rates the proposed 2030 reduction target of 46% (42% excluding LULUCF credits) below 2013 levels as “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. This rating indicates that Japan’s target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Japan’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The CAT rates Japan’s 2030 reduction target of 46% (42% excluding LULUCF credits) below 2013 levels as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. This rating indicates that Japan’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C . Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions reductions target itself, others could come in the form of additional financial support for emissions reduction in developing countries. Japan’s target is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Japan’s approach, warming would reach up to 3°C. Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found here . The CAT rates Japan’s international public climate finance contributions as “Highly insufficient”. Japan remains committed to providing climate finance in the period post-2020 but contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating Japan needs to further accelerate commitments to increase climate finance and stop funding fossil fuel overseas. Japan reports significant levels of climate finance, but only a small share takes the form of grants or has climate as a primary objective (OECD, 2022). Japan also counts 50% of broader development projects as climate finance–- even though they are explicitly defined as not primarily targeting climate action (Carty & Kowalzig, 2022). The CAT accounted for these factors and the resulting finance considered in this rating is considerably lower than originally reported by the government. Japan has contributed to the achievement of the USD 100bn goal yearly until 2020 and commits ‘to maintain the same level of amount beyond 2020’. However, it is important to note that the USD 100bn goal itself is insufficient post-2020. A clear and sustained increase in international climate mitigation finance is thus fundamental in the post-2020 period. In this sense, it is positive that Prime Minister Kishida committed at COP26 to add USD 10bn for climate finance in general and USD 14.8bn for climate adaptation in particular (Reynolds, 2021). But more support is necessary. Japan is still investing in international fossil fuel projects but is gradually moving away from this. At the G7 summit in 2021 and 2022, Japan joined the commitment to end new public finance of unabated coal power by the end of 2021, and of other fossil projects by the end of 2022 (G7, 2021, 2022). While Japan accordingly cancelled its involvement in the coal power projects in Indonesia and Bangladesh (Nikkei Asia, 2022b), the country is still one of the largest investors in fossil fuels abroad including its support for international oil and gas upstream developments (Christoph Bals, 2022; Kumagai, 2022). In March 2023, Japan officially launched the Asia Zero Emissions Community (AZEC) initiative, a cooperation framework to help Asian countries ensure energy security while striving towards decarbonisation (METI, 2023b). Under the initiative, Japan will support countries in drawing up roadmaps for energy transitions and help them develop and implement “decarbonisation technologies”. However, these seem to also include carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies and hydrogen & ammonia co-firing, as ways to curb emissions in coal-fired power plants and gas-fired turbines/boilers (METI, 2023g). While these technologies have a role to play in the transition to net zero, they should only be used in hard-to-abate sectors, certainly not in the power sector, and particularly not as tools designed to curb emissions in coal-fired power plants. Through the AZEC initiative, Japan is also pushing for further development of LNG infrastructure in the region, as the government seeks to position fossil gas as a transitional fuel (METI, 2023a). However, such investment would further contribute to locking-in carbon-intensive developments: fossil gas needs to be phased out, globally, by only a few years after coal, to keep warming to 1.5˚C.

India,CAT rating of targets,"We take India’s emissions intensity target as its unconditional contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C and rate that against what a fair contribution would be. India has indicated that achieving the 50% non-fossil capacity target will require international support. We take this target as being conditional on international support and rate it against the level of reductions needed within India’s borders. The CAT methodology for rating NDCs is based on GHG emissions from fossil fuels, agriculture and industrial processes. We exclude the land sector from our calculations and thus do not evaluate the contribution of India’s carbon sink expansion efforts. We estimate that India's 50% non-fossil capacity target would result in an emissions level of between 4.2-4.5 GtCO 2 e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030. India is already on track to achieve more than 60% non-fossil capacity by 2030 under current policies, so achieving only the 50% in the NDC would actually result in higher emissions. We rate this target as “Highly insufficient” when compared to the level of reductions needed within India to be 1.5°C compatible. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that India’s conditional target leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow India’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. Our estimate for the 50% non-fossil capacity target is based on the underlying power sector scenario of the current policy pathways. The lower bound of the power sector scenario is based on the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2023 Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). The upper bound of the power sector scenario is based on the adopted National Electricity Plan 2023 (NEP2023) (please refer to the assumptions section for the methodology used in estimating targets). Substantial improvement is needed in this target and India will need international support to get onto a 1.5°C pathway. Even if India is not responsible for paying for all its emission reductions, it should develop plans to rapidly cut emissions conditional on sufficient international support being available, and not lock itself into a high carbon future. This would mean starting to phase out coal use, adopting emission reduction plans across the economy, and clearly specifying what international support it requires to achieve a 1.5°C compatible target. We estimate that India’s emissions intensity target would result in an emissions level of 4.6 GtCO 2 e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030. This emissions level is above where we project India’s emissions to be in 2030 under current policies and action. We rate the intensity target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that India’s unconditional target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. India’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow India’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The quantification of this target varies depending on how GDP is measured and assumptions made about 2030 projections. The transparency of India’s target could be improved with further information on these elements. Also, while an emissions intensity target may contribute to decoupling emissions from economic growth, this type of target may not be sufficient to address the urgency of climate change, as overall emissions could continue to rise.

For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant. Germany does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its national target through domestic action alone. We rate its national target against both global domestic pathways and fairness metrics. We rate Germany’s 2030 reduction target of 65% below 1990 levels as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Germany’s national target in 2030 is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Germany’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. While the proposed target represents a significant improvement compared to its previous target, Germany’s new target is not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and needs further improvement. We rate Germany’s 2030 target of 65% below 1990 levels excl. LULUCF as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Germany’s national target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. Germany should both further increase its emissions reduction target and provide significantly more and predictable finance to others to meet its fair-share contribution. Germany’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Germany’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Germany’s international climate finance is rated “Insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve Germany’s fair share rating. Germany’s international public climate finance contributions are better than most developed countries but still rated “Insufficient.” Germany has committed to increasing its climate finance but contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share as assessed by the CAT. To improve its rating, Germany needs to increase its international climate finance contributions by around a factor of three in the period post-2020 and urgently stop funding fossil fuel projects abroad. At COP26, Germany signed a declaration to stop financing fossil fuels abroad, but the sector guidelines for export credits still allows investments in existing and new fossil fuel infrastructure outside Germany's borders (Die Bundesregierung, 2023). Germany is the biggest European climate finance donor. According to the CAT estimates, its contributions represent more than half of the EU contributions. However, due to the high fair share requirements assessed by the CAT, Germany’s current contributions remain “Highly insufficient.” Most German contributions for climate finance are distributed via bilateral development cooperation. Funding is implemented by Gesellschaft für internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and KfW Development Bank. The International Climate Initiative (IKI) is a separate funding mechanism of the Climate and Economics Ministry (BMWK), the Environment Ministry (BMU), and the Federal Foreign Office (AA). A smaller share is disbursed through contributions to multilateral climate funds. A significant share of the finance takes the form of grants, but Germany also relies on other financial instruments, such as concessional loans (Deutsche Klimafinanzierung, 2021). Germany remains committed to the global USD 100bn goal in climate finance for developing countries per year through 2025, but the USD 100bn goal in itself is insufficient post-2020. At the G7 Summit in June 2021, Germany committed to increase climate finance by EUR 2bn to a total level of EUR 6bn annually by 2025 (Kanzleramt Deutschland, 2021). In 2022, the German government successfully reached its objective of providing more than EUR 6bn for climate finance (BMZ, 2023). The increase in climate finance is due to the growing demand for climate programmes in recipient countries and exceptional factors, such as special funds for food security in Ukraine, which are counted towards the goal. Initially, the government had projected around EUR 4.3 bn annually from 2021 to 2023 (Kowalzig, 2022). However, the forecast for 2023 and 2024 is significantly lower, at around EUR 5.14bn and EUR 5.3bn, respectively. The planned cuts, starting in 2025, are a cause for concern. The German government intends to make further cuts in development cooperation, including climate finance, which will amount to billions of euros. This decision, led by Federal Finance Minister Christian Lindner, is part of a worrying trend. These cuts could undermine long-term climate projects, potentially affecting bilateral commitments crucial for climate initiatives in recipient countries (Kowalzig, 2024). In 2023, during the Petersberg Dialogue, Germany announced EUR 2bn of climate finance for the replenishment of the Green Climate Fund, a third more than in the previous round (The German Government, 2023). The Climate Action Tracker climate finance rating focuses on finance for climate change mitigation, and the data shows an increase in this area over the years, which results in a positive rating of the contribution's trend. A clear and sustained increase in international climate mitigation finance across all areas is fundamental.

Germany,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"In June 2021, Germany adopted its 2045 net zero target in its revised climate law.

Germany’s target covers all sectors and gases, underpinned by an emissions pathway to 2040 and the communication of binding sectoral targets until 2030. International aviation and shipping remain outside of the target’s scope. A periodic and legally-binding review process of measures and interim targets by an Expert Council is in place. Germany provides separate reduction and removal targets with regards to LULUCF but remains unclear on any other carbon removal. The net zero target is enshrined in law in Germany’s climate law 2021. The German government has failed to provide explicit and transparent assumptions on some key elements of its net zero target. The proposed measures aim to achieve net zero on Germany’s own territory, but the climate law explicitly reserves the right to use international offset credits.

Egypt would need to roughly stabilise emissions at today’s levels to meet its fair share of the global mitigation effort to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C. Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found here .",
Egypt,Net zero and other long-term target(s),"Egypt does not have a net zero target, nor has it submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC as of July 2023. Egypt launched its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy in May 2022 but it does not include an emissions reduction target (Government of Egypt, 2022).",
